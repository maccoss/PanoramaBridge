    print("🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED:")
    print("1. ✅ Removed expensive checksum verification (no more file downloads)")
    print("2. ✅ Added multi-format ETag support (SHA256 + MD5)")
    print("3. ✅ Enhanced server compatibility (Apache, etc.)")
    print("4. ✅ Improved verification messages for clarity")
    print("5. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect actual behavior")

    print("🚀 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:")
    print("- Eliminated file downloads for verification (major bandwidth savings)")
    print("- ETag comparison is network-efficient (headers only)")
    print("- MD5 calculation only when server uses MD5 ETags")
    print("- Fallback verification uses minimal bandwidth (8KB head request)")
    print("- Overall verification is much faster for all file sizes")

    print("🔧 TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS:")
    print("Multi-Format ETag Support:")
    print("  • SHA256 ETags: Direct comparison with local file checksum")
    print("  • MD5 ETags: Calculates MD5 of local file for Apache servers")
    print("  • Unknown formats: Falls back to size + accessibility verification")
    print("  • Proper ETag cleaning (removes quotes and weak indicators)")

    print("Integrity Detection:")
    print("  • Same-length hash mismatch = File integrity problem")

    print("📝 NEW VERIFICATION MESSAGES:")
    print("Users now see clear, specific messages:")

    print('  • "Remote file verified by Size + accessibility (ETag unavailable)"')

    print("🗂️ CODE STRUCTURE CHANGES:")
    print("Removed Methods:")

    print("Enhanced Methods:")
    print("  • verify_remote_file_integrity() - multi-level approach with ETag priority")
    print("  • Enhanced ETag format detection and handling")
    print("  • Improved conflict resolution integration")
    print()
    
    print("📚 DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:")
    print("  • Updated REMOTE_INTEGRITY_CHECK_IMPLEMENTATION.md")
    print("  • Clarified that checksums are for metadata, not verification")
    print("  • Updated UI tooltips to reflect new approach")
    print("  • Enhanced code comments throughout")
    print()
    
    print("🧪 TESTING:")
    print("  • Updated test_multilevel_verification.py to test new features")
    print("  • Created demo_multi_etag_support.py for demonstration")
    print("  • Tests verify removal of expensive patterns")
    print("  • Tests confirm multi-format ETag support")
    print()
    
    print("✨ USER EXPERIENCE BENEFITS:")
    print("  • Much faster verification (no file downloads)")
    print("  • Better server compatibility (works with Apache, etc.)")
    print("  • Clearer status messages (no confusion about verification method)")
    print("  • Reduced bandwidth usage")
    print("  • Maintained security (integrity problems still detected)")
    print()
    
    print("🔍 VERIFICATION HIERARCHY (NEW):")
    print("  Level 1: File size comparison (instant)")
