## How PanoramaBridge Works: Step-by-Step Process

PanoramaBridge follows a systematic approach to monitor, verify, and transfer files to remote WebDAV servers. Here's the detailed process:

### 1. File Discovery and Monitoring

**Directory Scanning Methods:**
- **Primary Method**: OS-level file system events using the `watchdog` library
  - Monitors `on_created`, `on_modified`, and `on_moved` events
  - **Immediate detection** with no polling overhead
  - Handles file extensions: `.raw`, `.wiff`, `.mzML`, `.mzXML`, etc.
- **Backup Method**: Optional polling (disabled by default)
  - Configurable 1-30 minute intervals
  - Uses `os.walk()` for recursive scanning or `os.listdir()` for single directory
  - Only enabled when file system events are unreliable (network mounts, WSL2)

**Extension Filtering:**
- Case-insensitive matching against user-configured extensions
- Filters out hidden files (starting with `.` or `~`)
- Supports both recursive and non-recursive directory monitoring

### 2. File Stability Verification

**Stability Detection:**
- Tracks file size changes over time using a pending files dictionary
- Default 1-second stability timeout (file size unchanged)
- Prevents uploading files still being written by instruments
- Smart locked file handling for mass spectrometer workflows

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Maintains sets of `queued_files` and `processing_files` to prevent duplicates
- Checks against remote paths to avoid re-uploading same destinations

### 3. Remote File Existence Check

**WebDAV PROPFIND Method:**
```http
PROPFIND /remote/path/filename.raw HTTP/1.1
Host: panoramaweb.org
Depth: 0
```

**Verification Process:**
- Sends HTTP PROPFIND request to check if file already exists on remote server
- Retrieves remote file metadata: size, modification time, ETag
- If file exists, compares with local file for conflict resolution
- Creates necessary remote directories using WebDAV `MKCOL` method

### 4. Checksum Calculation

**SHA256 Algorithm with Caching:**
- **Method**: SHA256 hash calculation using Python's `hashlib` library
- **Chunk Size**: 256KB chunks for optimal memory/performance balance
- **Caching System**: Local cache using file path + size + modification time as key
  - Up to 1,700x performance improvement for unchanged files
  - Cache limit: 1,000 entries with automatic cleanup
  - Cache invalidation on file size or modification time changes

**Implementation:**
```python
hash_obj = hashlib.sha256()
with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
    while chunk := f.read(256 * 1024):  # 256KB chunks
        hash_obj.update(chunk)
checksum = hash_obj.hexdigest()
```

### 5. File Upload Process

**Adaptive Chunked Upload:**
- **Chunk Size Determination** (based on file size):
  - Files < 100MB: 64KB chunks
  - 100MB - 1GB: 256KB chunks
  - 1GB - 5GB: 1MB chunks
  - 5GB - 10GB: 2MB chunks
  - Files > 10GB: 4MB chunks

**Upload Methods:**
- **Large Files (>100MB)**: Attempts Range request chunking
  - Multiple HTTP PUT requests with `Content-Range` headers
  - True progress tracking with real-time callbacks
- **Standard Files**: Single HTTP PUT request with streaming
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress callbacks with bytes uploaded

**HTTP Implementation:**
```http
PUT /webdav/remote/path/filename.raw HTTP/1.1
Host: panoramaweb.org
Content-Range: bytes 0-1048575/104857600
Content-Length: 1048576
Authorization: Basic <credentials>

[file chunk data]
```

### 6. Upload Verification

**Two-Tier Verification System:**

**For Files < 50MB:**
- Downloads complete remote file to temporary location
- Calculates SHA256 checksum of downloaded file
- Compares local and remote checksums for exact match
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

**For Files â‰¥ 50MB:**
- **ETag Comparison**: Compares server ETag with local checksum
- **Size Verification**: Confirms remote file size matches local
- **Storage Optimization**: Avoids downloading large files for verification

**Verification Methods:**
```python
# Small file verification
remote_checksum = calculate_checksum(downloaded_temp_file)
verified = (remote_checksum.lower() == local_checksum.lower())

# Large file verification
verified = (clean_etag.lower() == local_checksum.lower()) or size_matches
```

### 7. Metadata Storage and Integrity

**Checksum Storage:**
- Stores checksums on WebDAV server as metadata files
- File naming: `filename.raw.checksum` containing SHA256 hash
- Used for future conflict resolution and integrity verification

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Compares local checksum with stored remote checksum
- User notification for checksum mismatches
- Options to overwrite, skip, or manual resolution

### 8. Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Locked File Handling:**
- **Detection**: Identifies files locked by mass spectrometers during acquisition
- **Smart Retry**: Configurable wait times and retry intervals
  - Default: 30-minute initial wait, 30-second retry interval, 20 max attempts
- **Progress Indication**: Shows elapsed time and countdown timers
- **Status Messages**: "File locked - waiting for instrument (5/30 minutes elapsed)"

**Network Resilience:**
- Automatic retry for network failures
- Persistent HTTP sessions for connection reuse
- Timeout handling and connection management
- Comprehensive error logging with detailed diagnostic information

This systematic approach ensures reliable, efficient, and verified file transfer while providing comprehensive monitoring and error handling for laboratory mass spectrometry workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems

1. **"Connection Failed" Error**
   - Verify Panorama server URL (usually `https://panoramaweb.org`)
   - The application automatically tries `/webdav` endpoint if needed
   - Check username and password
   - Try both Basic and Digest authentication types
   - Ensure server is accessible from your network

2. **Keyring/Credential Storage Issues**
   - If you see "keyring backend not available" errors:
     - The application automatically installs `keyrings.alt` package
     - Restart the application after installation
     - Credentials will be saved securely on subsequent attempts

#### File Monitoring Issues

3. **Files Not Being Detected**
   - Verify directory path is correct and accessible
   - Check file extensions match exactly (case-insensitive)
   - Ensure files are being created in the monitored directory
   - Check subdirectory monitoring setting if files are in subfolders
   - File stability timeout may need adjustment for large files
   - **WSL2 Users**: For better file system event detection on Windows, use the native Windows build with `.venv-win`

4. **Locked File Handling (Mass Spectrometer Workflows)**
   - **"File locked - waiting for instrument"**: This is normal behavior when instruments are writing data
   - **Progress indication**: Status shows elapsed wait time like "File locked - waiting for instrument (5/30 minutes elapsed)"
   - **Configuration**: Adjust wait times in Advanced Settings â†’ Locked File Handling
   - **Immediate retry**: If you know a file is ready, restart monitoring to retry immediately
   - **Max retries exceeded**: Increase max retries or check if instrument finished writing
   - **Troubleshooting**: Check logs for "File locked during checksum" messages

#### Upload Problems

5. **Upload Verification Issues**
   - **"Verification failed" after successful upload**:
     - Check network stability during verification download
     - For files > 50MB, verification uses size/ETag comparison only
     - Disable verification in Transfer Settings if experiencing frequent issues
     - Manual verification: Compare file sizes and download checksums separately
   - **Slow upload verification**:
     - Verification downloads small files (< 50MB) to verify checksums
     - Large files use faster ETag/size comparison
     - Disable verification for maximum upload speed (less secure)

5. **Folder Creation Failures (HTTP 403)**
   - **Permission Denied**: Most common issue
   - Contact your Panorama administrator to request write permissions
   - Try creating folders in directories where you have write access
   - Check if you're in the correct user directory path

5. **Path Encoding Issues (HTTP 409 - Path Conflict)**
   - **Special Characters in Directory Names**: Fixed in current version
   - Previously, directories with `@` symbols (like `@files`) could cause encoding issues
   - The application now properly handles URL encoding/decoding for special characters
   - If you encounter path conflicts, try refreshing the directory listing

6. **Upload Failures**
   - Check available space on Panorama server
   - Verify write permissions for the selected remote path
   - Try reducing chunk size for problematic connections
   - Check network connectivity and stability
   - Monitor the application logs via View â†’ View Application Logs

#### Performance Issues

7. **Large File Problems**
   - Chunk sizes are automatically optimized based on file size
   - Ensure stable network connection
   - Check server timeout settings
   - Monitor system memory usage during transfers
