## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Problems

1. **"Connection Failed" Error**
   - Verify Panorama server URL (usually `https://panoramaweb.org`)
   - The application automatically tries `/webdav` endpoint if needed
   - Check username and password
   - Try both Basic and Digest authentication types
   - Ensure server is accessible from your network

2. **Keyring/Credential Storage Issues**
   - If you see "keyring backend not available" errors:
     - The application automatically installs `keyrings.alt` package
     - Restart the application after installation
     - Credentials will be saved securely on subsequent attempts

#### File Monitoring Issues

3. **Files Not Being Detected**
   - Verify directory path is correct and accessible
   - Check file extensions match exactly (case-insensitive)
   - Ensure files are being created in the monitored directory
   - Check subdirectory monitoring setting if files are in subfolders
   - File stability timeout may need adjustment for large files
   - **WSL2 Users**: For better file system event detection on Windows, use the native Windows build with `.venv-win`

4. **Locked File Handling (Mass Spectrometer Workflows)**
   - **"File locked - waiting for instrument"**: This is normal behavior when instruments are writing data
   - **Progress indication**: Status shows elapsed wait time like "File locked - waiting for instrument (5/30 minutes elapsed)"
   - **Configuration**: Adjust wait times in Advanced Settings â†’ Locked File Handling
   - **Immediate retry**: If you know a file is ready, restart monitoring to retry immediately
   - **Max retries exceeded**: Increase max retries or check if instrument finished writing
   - **Troubleshooting**: Check logs for "File locked during checksum" messages

#### Upload Problems

5. **Upload Verification Issues**
   - **"Verification failed" after successful upload**: 
     - Check network stability during verification download
     - For files > 50MB, verification uses size/ETag comparison only
     - Disable verification in Transfer Settings if experiencing frequent issues
     - Manual verification: Compare file sizes and download checksums separately
   - **Slow upload verification**:
     - Verification downloads small files (< 50MB) to verify checksums
     - Large files use faster ETag/size comparison
     - Disable verification for maximum upload speed (less secure)

5. **Folder Creation Failures (HTTP 403)**
   - **Permission Denied**: Most common issue
   - Contact your Panorama administrator to request write permissions
   - Try creating folders in directories where you have write access
   - Check if you're in the correct user directory path

5. **Path Encoding Issues (HTTP 409 - Path Conflict)**
   - **Special Characters in Directory Names**: Fixed in current version
   - Previously, directories with `@` symbols (like `@files`) could cause encoding issues
   - The application now properly handles URL encoding/decoding for special characters
   - If you encounter path conflicts, try refreshing the directory listing

6. **Upload Failures**
   - Check available space on Panorama server
   - Verify write permissions for the selected remote path
   - Try reducing chunk size for problematic connections
   - Check network connectivity and stability
   - Monitor the application logs via View â†’ View Application Logs

#### Performance Issues

7. **Large File Problems**
   - Increase chunk size to 50-100MB for files >1GB
   - Ensure stable network connection
   - Check server timeout settings
   - Monitor system memory usage during transfers

### Panorama-Specific Notes

#### Server Configuration

- **Panorama WebDAV Endpoint**: Typically `/webdav` (auto-detected)
- **Authentication**: Usually Basic authentication
- **File Types**: Commonly used for `.raw`, `.mzML`, `.mzXML`, `.wiff` files
- **Directory Structure**: Often organized by project/experiment

#### Permissions

- Write access must be granted by Panorama administrators
- Users typically have access to their own directories
- Project-specific permissions may apply
- Contact your Panorama administrator for access issues
