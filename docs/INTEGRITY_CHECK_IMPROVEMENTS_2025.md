# Integrity Check System Improvements (2025)

## Overview

The PanoramaBridge integrity check system has been significantly enhanced to provide better conflict resolution and more accurate file verification. These improvements address user feedback about confusing error messages and incorrect corruption assumptions.

## Key Changes

### 1. No More Corruption Assumptions

**Previous Behavior:**
- File size/checksum mismatches were automatically labeled as "corruption"
- System assumed remote files were corrupted when differences were detected
- Limited options for handling file differences

**New Behavior:**
- File differences are treated as **conflicts**, not corruption
- System recognizes that differences could be legitimate changes (local or server-side)
- Uses configured conflict resolution settings to determine appropriate action

### 2. Comprehensive File Coverage

**Previous Behavior:**
- Only checked files that were previously uploaded (in upload history)
- Could miss files that should be on the remote server

**New Behavior:**
- Checks **ALL local files** in the monitored directory
- Ensures complete coverage of files that should be uploaded
- Verifies that every local file has a corresponding remote file

### 3. Improved Error Categorization

**Previous Categories:**
- `verified` - File confirmed intact
- `missing` - File not found on remote
- `corrupted` - File differs from expected (assumed corruption)
- `changed` - Local file modified since upload
- `errors` - Network or other errors

**New Categories:**
- `verified` - File confirmed intact on remote
- `missing` - File not found on remote (automatically queued for upload)
- `changed` - File differs between local and remote (uses conflict resolution)
- `errors` - Network or verification errors

**Note:** The `corrupted` category has been eliminated as the system no longer assumes corruption.

### 4. Better User Communication

**Previous Messages:**
- "2 files not in upload history"
- "2 other errors"
- "Files corrupted on remote"

**New Messages:**
- "File conflict detected - applying conflict resolution"
- "Missing from remote - adding to upload queue"
- Clear explanations of what actions will be taken

## Technical Implementation

### IntegrityCheckThread Changes

```python
# Previous logic - assumed corruption
if not remote_ok and "mismatch" in reason:
    self.results['corrupted'] += 1
    # Assumed corruption, queued for re-upload

# New logic - conflict resolution
if not remote_ok and "mismatch" in reason:
    self.results['changed'] += 1
    # Treats as conflict, applies user settings
    self.file_issue_signal.emit(filepath, "changed", conflict_reason)
```

### Conflict Resolution Integration

The integrity check now properly integrates with the existing conflict resolution system:

1. **Detects Differences**: When files differ between local and remote
2. **Applies User Settings**: Uses configured conflict resolution ("Ask me each time", "Always upload", etc.)
3. **Respects User Choice**: Shows dialog when set to "Ask me each time"
4. **Takes Appropriate Action**: Based on user selection or configured setting

### Signal Improvements

**File Issue Signals:**
- `missing` - File not found on remote, automatically queued for upload
- `changed` - File differs, conflict resolution applied

**Progress Updates:**
- Clear status messages during verification process
- Specific actions being taken for each file
- Progress indication with file counts

## User Benefits

### 1. No False Corruption Warnings
- System no longer assumes files are corrupted when they differ
- Reduces user anxiety about data integrity
- Allows for legitimate file changes on both sides

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- All local files are verified, not just upload history
- Ensures complete file synchronization
- Catches files that may have been missed in previous versions

### 3. Consistent Conflict Handling
- Same conflict resolution logic used throughout the application
- User's preferred handling method is respected
- Consistent behavior across all file operations

### 4. Clear User Guidance
- Specific information about what actions are being taken
- Better error messages with actionable next steps
- Reduced confusion about file status

## Migration Impact

### For Existing Users
- Existing conflict resolution settings continue to work
- Upload history is preserved and respected
- No changes to basic functionality

### For Workflows
- More reliable integrity verification
- Better handling of collaborative workflows where files may change on server
- Reduced false positives about corruption

## Testing

The improvements include comprehensive test coverage:

- **test_integrity_check_thread_all_scenarios**: Tests various file scenarios
- **test_changed_file_detection**: Verifies conflict detection and resolution
- **test_missing_file_handling**: Ensures missing files are properly handled

All tests have been updated to reflect the new behavior and verify correct conflict resolution integration.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Optional checksum-based verification for high-security environments
- Batch conflict resolution for multiple file conflicts
- Enhanced logging of integrity check results

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing features and settings remain functional
- Upload history format unchanged
- No breaking changes to user workflows

## Conclusion

These improvements make PanoramaBridge more reliable and user-friendly by:
- Eliminating false corruption assumptions
- Providing comprehensive file coverage
- Integrating proper conflict resolution
- Delivering clear, actionable user feedback

The enhanced integrity check system ensures that all local files are properly synchronized with the remote server while respecting user preferences for handling file conflicts.
